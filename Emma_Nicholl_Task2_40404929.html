            BBC's <cite>Merlin</cite> (2008-2012) might at first seem to be one of many mediocre fantasy shows produced
            post-2000<sup>1</sup>,
            best put by its Wikipedia page as
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(2008_TV_series)#">
            A British fantasy-adventure drama television programme, loosely based on the Arthurian legends regarding the
            close relations of Merlin and King Arthur.
            The programme is a reimagining of the legend, in which young warlock Merlin is sent to the kingdom of
            Camelot by his mother because of his "special gift". After saving Prince Arthur's life in the first episode,
            he becomes Arthur's manservant. Merlin soon learns that the reason for his gift is to protect Arthur
        </blockquote>
        <br>However, as an occasional watcher of the genre I feel best placed to judge them all, and have
        (reasonably) concluded that Merlin best encompasses everything absolutely insane about this era of television -
        from its ridiculously confusing plot
        to the wildly variable accents of what is apparently the same region
        <br><br>Thus, I have created this website (and this handy navigation tool) to demonstrate my point, but to also spread the joy.

        <h2>The population of Camelot</h2>
        <p>
            Merlin contains far too many characters for me to fit onto one page (I also forgot about a lot of them to be
            honest), and to cover all of them would have created an entirely unmanageable webpage.
            <br>
            Therefore, for the purposes of this webpage, I've limited the character table to those deemed main
            characters via

        <h2>Merlin's Greatest Moments</h2>
        <p>Across 65 episodes, Merlin covered a multitude a stories both of the legends
            and of their own creation (a real highlight is when Merlin is poisoned and decides to kill Arthur).
            Therefore, in order to fully experience every level of this show, I have compiled a list of the top 5
            best and worst episodes according to IMDB<sup>2</sup>, along with my personal top 5.

        <h2>My personal opinions on why Merlin is the GOAT</h2>
        <p>As this website has demonstrated, I am deeply, deeply invested in promoting
            this show to as many people as possible. Therefore, I have decided to summarise
            all of my feelings into this brief list of pros and cons of watching the show
            (but even the cons are pros if you don't care).

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short and sweet (65 episodes in total)</li>
                    <li>Requires absolutely no brain power to watch</li>
                    <li>Very very nice costumes</li>
                    <li>Really great guest stars</li>
                    <li>The soundtrack is beautiful</li>
                    <li>You'll never quite be sure what happens next</li>
                    <li>Merlin has a hugely active online fandom post-2012, and
                        has a wealth of fan-created activity to enjoy after you create the show
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The CGI is horrendous</li>
                    <li>The plot is nonsensical in multiple aspects</li>
                    <li>The geography of the show makes no sense</li>
                    <li>The historical time period of the show is all over the place
                        - the costumes are medieval yet the legends are from the 4th/5th century
                    </li>
                    <li>The finale is absolutely wild in the worst way</li>
                    <li>The fanfiction is something else (allegedly)</li>
